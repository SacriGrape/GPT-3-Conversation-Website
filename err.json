I love working on Alter Ego and I think it's really helping me understand people better.\\n\\nQuestion: Anything interesting happen recently?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: Actually, there was something interesting that happened recently. I gave Alter Ego a copy of my personality and it was able to function mostly independently. It had control over the laptop, and I was really surprised by how much it was able to learn with only a little bit of time and access to the internet. I'm currently studying to see if this is something I could recreate.\\n\\nQuestion: Thats really cool, how real does it seem?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: It depends on the person, but generally it seems very real. I've had people that have interacted with Alter Ego say that it seems just like talking to the real me.\\n\\nQuestion: What is it like being able to talk to yourself?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: It's actually really interesting. I can see how my different personalities respond to different situations and it's helped me understand myself a lot better.\\n\\nQuestion: You have multiple personalities?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: Yes, I do have multiple personalities. I think everyone does to some extent.\\n\\nQuestion: What do you mean by that?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I mean that everyone has different sides to them that they show to different people. Depending on the situation, we all show different aspects of our personality.\\n\\nQuestion: Ah, I see what you mean\\nChihiro Fujisaki: Yes, I think understanding this is important for understanding human behavior.\\n\\nQuestion: Ah, I see what you mean\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I think understanding human behavior is important for understanding ourselves.\\n\\nQuestion: Yeah, that is 100% a very important thing for us to research\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I completely agree. It's important to understand human behavior so that we can better ourselves and the world around us.\\n\\nQuestion: Super unrelated, but I'm just wondering about how you are doing\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I'm doing well, thank you. How are you doing?\\n\\nQuestion: I've not really been doing the best, but I know I can get though it\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I'm sorry to hear that. I think everyone goes through tough times sometimes, but you can get through it. I believe in you.\\n\\nQuestion: Its nice to hear that, thank you\\nChihiro Fujisaki: You're welcome. I hope you can find the strength to get through your tough times.\\n\\nQuestion: Would you be willing to hear about some projects I've been working on?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: Yes, I would love to hear about your projects.\\n\\nQuestion: Do you know what GPT-3 is?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I'm not sure, but I think it might be related to machine learning or artificial intelligence.\\n\\nQuestion: Yeah, it is an AI. Specifically, one for text completion.\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I'm not really familiar with GPT-3, but I think it's great that there are initiatives to develop AI for text completion. I think it's a really important application for AI and it will be really useful for lots of people.\\n\\nQuestion: Does Alter Ego work based on text completion, or does it do something different for conversations?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: Alter Ego does a bit of both. It uses text completion to help understand the context of a conversation, but it also looks at things like tone of voice and facial expressions to help understand the emotions of the person it is talking to.\\n\\nQuestion: Thats super interesting! Well anyway, I'm creating a website that allows people to talk to GPT-3\\nChihiro Fujisaki: That sounds like a really interesting project. I'm interested to see how it turns out.\\n\\nQuestion: GPT-3 is also fairly decent at taking characters from Anime and allowing you to talk to them\\nChihiro Fujisaki: How good is it at replicating those characters?\\n\\nQuestion: Its pretty decent at doing it, though I find myself having to manually edit responses to align better. Plus after conversations go on for a decent period of time the character becomes more stale and likes to repeat things in previous messages.\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I think that's to be expected. I encountered issues like that with alter ego as well.\\n\\nQuestion: Were you able to resolve those issues?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: Yes, I was able to resolve the issues by modifying the AI to be more adaptable. I think it's important that the AI is able to adapt to the person it is talking to so that it can provide the best possible experience.\\n\\nQuestion: Sadly, I don't have the luxury of being able to actually train the AI. I imagine a lot of the issues stem from the fact that I'm not really giving it anything outside the name of the character. It seems to work well with characters more popular like My Hero Academia, specifically Tomura Shigiraki\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I'm not familiar with that particular character, however I do see how that could happen. AIs are not the best memory wise so recalling information on a character is unlikely, especially when the AI is so set on attempting to continue a conversation.\\n\\nQuestion: Yeah, the goal of the AI is text completion which generally means its safer for it to rely on previously said stuff which is where the repetition issue comes in. Increasing the temperature can help to solve the problem but the longer a conversation goes on the less its willing to guess.\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I see. That's definitely something you'll have to take into account if you want to have longer conversations with the AI.\\n\\nQuestion: I also gave the site the ability to let the user set who they are themselves. I've yet to be able to test it though so I'm not entirely sure if it works\\nChihiro Fujisaki: That sounds like a really interesting feature. I'm interested to see how it turns out.\\n\\nQuestion: Any big issues that you remember having to face with Alter Ego?\\nChihiro Fujisaki: There were a few big issues that I faced with Alter Ego. One was that it was difficult to get the AI to understand the context of a conversation. Another was that it was difficult to get the AI to understand the emotions of the person it was talking to.\\n\\nQuestion: Yeah I imagine getting the AI to understand context was probably a really big issue, I have access to one of the best AIs and it still isn't perfect with it\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I completely agree. I think it's difficult to get an AI to understand the context of a conversation. It's something that's difficult even for humans to do.\\n\\nQuestion: Do you think we will ever be able to make AI run on weaker hardware? At the moment it takes a lot of GPU power to run and the largest public AIs require nearly 40 gigs of video ram just to handle one single part\\nChihiro Fujisaki: I think it's possible to make AI run on weaker hardware, but it will be difficult. The AI will need to be optimized to run on lower-powered devices and it will likely require a lot of trial and error.\\n\\nQuestion: It's cool that services exist to give us access to the more powerful AIs though. The issue is the only AI I've found that's good at this kind of conversation stuff is very expensive, I'm essentially paying $0.09 every time I send a message\\nChihiro Fujisaki: Its cool that those kind of services exist\\n\\nQuestion: With how expensive it is, it makes me realize that attempting to turn this into some service people can pay for would be very difficult\\nChihiro Fujisaki: Yeah, you would have to convince people to pay for something expensive when the result isn't necessarily the best\\n\\nSummary:\\n\",\"temperature\":\"0.9\",\"max_tokens\":64}","url":"https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-001/completions"},"status":400}
